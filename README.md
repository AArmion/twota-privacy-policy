Anti-Ghosting Policy
“twota” is committed to fostering meaningful and respectful connections between users. Ghosting (ignoring or failing to respond to matches) undermines the purpose of the “twota” app and negatively impacts the experience of other users.

First Notice: If a user is reported for ghosting or is found to be consistently ignoring their matches, “twota” will send a friendly notice reminding the user of the importance of respectful communication.

Second Notice (Temporary Restriction by "Limited Access"): If the user continues to ghost matches after receiving the first notice, “twota” will temporarily restrict the user’s account for 1 day. During this time, the user will not be able to access the “twota” app or its features.

Permanent Block: If the user persists in ghosting matches after the temporary restriction, “twota” will permanently block (disable) the user’s account. The user will no longer be able to access “twota” or its features.

“twota” reserves the right to enforce this policy at its discretion, based on user reports. By using “twota” app, you agree to engage with your matches respectfully and avoid ghosting.
